            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This taco casserole with ground beef and tortilla chips is easy to make and very tasty. I
                often substitute with ground turkey and low-fat dairy products, and it's still delicious!
                Serve this casserole with chips, salsa, and green salad.
