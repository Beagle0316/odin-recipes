            <p>
                Truffle mac and chees is one of my favorite things to make when there's a chill in the air.
                It's great for cheese lovers, like myself, and works well at dinner parties. The leftovers are
                good too! Truffle oil is one of the best culinary purchases I've made. One little bottle has 
                lasted me a year and can be used with so many things. Top this dish with a pinch of truffle
                salf if desired.

            </ul>
            <h2 class="recipeHeader">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling
                    water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
                    Drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat.
                    Whisk flour into melted butter until mixture has a thick, paste-like consistency, 
                    about 30 seconds. Slowly whish in 2 cups milk until smooth. Stir in remaining
                    milk, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, whishking constantly, until
                    thick and almost boiling, 5 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Gouda, Cheddar, Swiss, and 1 cup Parmesan; stir until cheeses melt and
                    sauce is smooth. Fold in cooked cavatappi until coated. Pour mixture into the
                    prepared baking dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan chees and bread crumbs together in a small
                    bowl; sprinkle over cavatappi mixture, then drizzle truffle oil over top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and topping is golden, about
                    30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
